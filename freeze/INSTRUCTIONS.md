# Actorization project - `freeze`

[freeze](https://github.com/charmbracelet/freeze) can generate screenshots of source code. This is the example that we showed in the introductory talk.

Feel free to improve it in any way you like, presumably by adding further options.

## General instructions

You will need to [sign up](https://console.apify.com/sign-up) for an Apify account. It's a one click procedure if you use your Google account and you don't need to enter your credit card.

If you prefer working with CLIs over web consoles, you may want to [install the Apify CLI](https://docs.apify.com/cli/docs/installation) as well. It can be installed either from the NPM registry or via Homebrew.
